## Where presets live {#where}

rusty-amp searches these directories, in order:

<ol class="steps">
<li><code>./presets/</code> — bundled presets (read-only, shipped with the repo).</li>
<li><code>~/.config/rusty-amp/presets/</code> — your personal presets.</li>
</ol>

Press <kbd>P</kbd> while playing to open the preset browser. Press <kbd>S</kbd> (from anywhere) to save the current state as a new user preset. The browser updates instantly — no restart required.

Bundled presets are marked as system presets and cannot be deleted from within the app. User presets show a `[user]` tag and can be deleted with <kbd>D</kbd>.

## Preset browser <span class="muted">(<kbd>P</kbd>)</span> {#browser}

Press <kbd>P</kbd> while playing to open the browser overlay. Move the cursor with <kbd>↑</kbd>/<kbd>↓</kbd> and press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to apply — the change takes effect immediately, with the audio uninterrupted.

Press <kbd>S</kbd> from anywhere to capture the current rig as a new preset. <kbd>Tab</kbd> moves between the two fields; <kbd>Enter</kbd> writes the file.

## Writing your own preset {#write}

A preset is a TOML file. Every section except `[tube_screamer]`, `[amp]`, and `[reverb]` is optional — omitting a section leaves that effect's current state unchanged. All knob values are normalised `0.0–1.0`.

```toml
